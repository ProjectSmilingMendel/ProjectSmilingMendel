		<b><u>Our current Proposal:</b></u><br>
		</heading1>
		<br>
Our current proposal is to manipulate the genome of Bacillus subtilis (strain: CU741 along with
others) by inserting multiple copies of the genes: irp2, iroN, iucA from the genome of E.coli .
These genes encode proteins called hydroxamate siderophores
		<br>
Mechanism of action of hydroxamate siderophores:
Siderophores are iron chelating compounds produced by a variety of organisms , and they
generally have ferric chelates with stability constants of approximately 10<sup>30</sup>. Plants produce
siderophores when they have a deficiency of iron and it has been shown that hydroxamate
siderophores have a high affinity to iron in the pH range from 4 to 10 and are more effective at
treating iron chlorosis than FeCl3.
		<br>
		Escherichia coli is a bacteria found in the lower intestines of warm blooded animals. It is known
to produce various virulence factors including aerobactin, yersiniabactin and salmochelin. These
three virulence factors, in particular happen to be hydroxamate siderophores which are used for
chelating iron from the intestines and the urinary tract. They are even able to displace iron from
some other siderophores.
		<br>
		
Aerobactin is encoded by iucDBAC gene cluster , salmochelin is encoded by iroA gene cluster
and yersiniabactin is encoded by HPI and irp2, irpl, ybtSETUXPQA gene clusters.
		<br>
		
These three siderophores( aerobactin , yersiniabactin and salmochelin), being present in the
intestines of animals, is speculated not to be bioavailable to most soil fungi, but at the same time
is bioavailable to plants. This hypothesis can be tested by culturing soil fungal pathogens and
plant seedlings separately with the iron-chelated form of these siderophores as the only iron
source.
		<br>

Because of the fact that these siderophores have the capability to displace iron from other
siderophores, given enough time, given a mixture containing these siderophores and others, the
mole fraction of these siderophores in iron chelated form will be greater than that of other
siderophores. If these iron chelated compounds can be absorbed by the plants but not by soil
fungi, they may cause iron deficiency in fungi and can also cure iron deficiency in plants. This
gives them a potential fungicidal action as well as a mineral nutrition function.
		<br>
		
Bacillus subtilis is a soil dwelling bacteria that is known to have antifungal action and is
generally harmless to plants.
		<br>
		
Insertion aerobactin gene(iucA), yersiniabactin gene (irp2), salmochelin gene (iroN) into Bacillus
subtilis should cause the bacillus to produce these siderophores in the soil, adding to the
antifungal action of B.subtilis.
		<br>
		
Another experiment to verify effectiveness of these siderophores would be to culture the fungi in
separate cultures of transformed bacillus and compare it against a culture of fungi in cultures
containing reference non-transformed bacillus.
