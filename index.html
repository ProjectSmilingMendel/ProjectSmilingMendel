		<br>
Development of multiple integrated systems to help plants deal with various biotic and
abiotic stresses.<br>
When it comes to using biocontrol agents, it is often suggested that biocontrol agents should be
used as preventive measures and not as treatments. Mostly because there is a time gap between
the application of the biocontrol agent and the observation of its impact. Since the user has to
take action even before the onset of the disease (s), the user must buy multiple biocontrol agents
developed by different companies separately which escalates the cost by many folds for the user.
Also, a lot of thinking has to go in coming up with different combinations of biocontrol agents to
be used simultaneously since they may interact with each other to display unwanted
consequences especially if they share a common niche. In order to simplify the usage of
biocontrol agents and reduce the cost for the user we propose the development of an integrated
system i.e. a single formulation (biocontrol agent) which would cover a broader spectrum of
pathogens. This will not only reduce the cost but also simplify the usage of biocontrol agents
thereby making the biological approach in farming more favorable. Also, since the biocontrol
agents are supposedly preventive measures, it makes sense to have beneficial biostimulant
properties along with the biocontrol traits for the formulation to provide better value for money
to the user. This shall not only prevent a broader spectrum of diseases but also help in improving
the yield in soil based systems.
